# calories-tracker
This is my Django project to help me keep track of my calories for the day.

I use Django for managing the website and PostgreSQL to manage the database. There are some simple functions such as login, logout, and create a meal by dragging ingredients in to meal box. The app will calculate amount of calories, carbohydrates, fat, and protein of the meal and save it to a database.

In the future, I will add visualization for the data collected and new functions that can support working out.
